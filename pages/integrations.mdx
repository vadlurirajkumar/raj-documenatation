# Integrations



Use FlyingDuck to compile a detailed inventory of all open-source libraries utilized within your applications. This facilitates transparency and compliance with software bill of materials (SBOM) standards. Conduct thorough scans to identify vulnerabilities present within integrated libraries, employing software composition analysis (SCA) methodologies to enhance security posture. Scan the source code to detect instances of hardcoded secrets, tokens, API keys, or credentials, thereby minimizing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.

Proactively identify and recommends the latest non-vulnerable versions of libraries, enabling users to safeguard against potential exploitation of known vulnerabilities. Track and address license violations in open-source components, supporting legal compliance efforts and mitigating associated risks. While this aspect is currently under development, it remains a crucial component of our roadmap to ensure comprehensive governance over software dependencies. 


FlyingDuck integrates seamlessly with a range of tools in your environment, enabling comprehensive security coverage for your entire tech stack. Our platform supports leading DevOps and cloud-native tools, as well as traditional security technologies, ensuring that potential vulnerabilities are identified and secured. With FlyingDuck, enjoy consolidated security and complete visibility without the complexity of managing multiple tools.

You are able to see a separate page in the flyingduck portal for **Integrations**. In this page you can see the available integrations for various tools, flyingduck will get only read access of your code/repos/organaisation.
