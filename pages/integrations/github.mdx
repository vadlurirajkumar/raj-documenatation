## Code Scan
The code scan can be done in two ways
- Workflows
- On-premise runner

### GitHub workflow

Select GitHub workflow to configure DuckDefender in GitHub by adding the yml file, that you need to download from the flyingduck portal for Libraries and Secrets information.

![GitHub workflow](../assets/github/githubworkflow.png)

#### Download DuckDefender

After selecting GitHub workflow, then click the **Download**. This will download the duckdefender.yml file which looks like this.

```mdx filename="DuckDefender.yml" copy
env:
  docker_tag: flyingduckio/duckdefender:latest

# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with GitHub Actions 
name: DuckDefender

# Triggers the workflow on push events but only for the all the critical branches
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "master", "main", "release", "develop" ]
  
# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

# Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    # Download image from docker hub

    - name: Download latest DuckDefender
      run: docker pull "${{env.docker_tag}}"

    - name: Run DuckDefender
      run: |
        docker run -e GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER="${{github.repository_owner}}" \
          -e GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER_ID="${{github.repository_owner_id}}" \
          -e GITHUB_REPOSITORY="${{github.repository}}" \
          -e GITHUB_REPOSITORY_ID="${{github.repository_id}}" \
          -e GITHUB_EVENT_NAME="${{github.event_name}}" \
          -e GITHUB_ACTOR="${{github.actor}}" \
          -e GITHUB_ACTOR_ID="${{github.actor_id}}" \
          -e FD_API_KEY="${{secrets.FD_API_KEY}}" \
          -e GITHUB_TOKEN="${{github.token}}" \
          -e GITHUB_HEAD_REF="${{github.head_ref}}" \
          -e GITHUB_BASE_REF="${{github.base_ref}}" \
          -e GITHUB_REF="${{github.ref}}" \
          -e GITHUB_SHA="${{github.sha}}" \
          -e WORKSPACE_PATH="/src" \
          -e LOG_LEVEL="debug" \
          -v "${{ github.workspace }}":/src  "${{env.docker_tag}}"
```

Add this file in your local code by following the below steps:
- create `.github` folder
- create `workflows` folder
- `DuckDefender.yaml` file

After adding the file you should commit. Based on which branch you've commited, if the branch is included in the given file, the respective data like libraries, secrets will be sent to FlyingDuck portal.

#### Custom Branch
If you want to commit to the custom branch like `features/**********` and to check the findings of that branch then include that specific branch into the branches in duckdefender.yml file.

```mdx filename="DuckDefender.yml" copy

# Triggers the workflow on push events but only for the all the critical branches
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "master", "main", "release", "develop" ]
```
