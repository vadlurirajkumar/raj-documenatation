#### Download DuckDefender

After selecting BitBucket workflow, then click the **Download**. This will download the bitbucket-pipelines.yml file which looks like this.

``` mdx filename="bitbucket-pipelines.yml" copy
# Version: '0.0.1'
pipelines:
  branches:
    main:
      - step: &DuckDefender
          name: DuckDefender scanner
          image: flyingduckio/duckdefender:latest
          caches:
            - docker
          script:
            # Define the DOCKER_TAG environment variable
            - export DOCKER_TAG="flyingduckio/duckdefender:latest"
            # Download image from docker hub
            - docker pull $DOCKER_TAG
            # Run the docker image
            - docker run  -e BITBUCKET_REPO_OWNER="$BITBUCKET_REPO_OWNER" -e BITBUCKET_REPO_SLUG="$BITBUCKET_REPO_SLUG"   -e BITBUCKET_BRANCH="$BITBUCKET_BRANCH"   -e BITBUCKET_COMMIT="$BITBUCKET_COMMIT"   -e FD_API_KEY="$FD_API_KEY"   -e PIPELINES_JWT_TOKEN="$PIPELINES_JWT_TOKEN" -e LOG_LEVEL="debug"  -e BITBUCKET_CLONE_DIR="$BITBUCKET_CLONE_DIR" -e ONLY_LATEST=True -v /opt/atlassian/pipelines/agent/build:/src  $DOCKER_TAG
          services:
            - docker

# Triggers the workflow on push events        
    master:
      - step: *DuckDefender
    develop:
      - step: *DuckDefender
    release:
      - step: *DuckDefender
      
```

After downloading the file go to **BitBucket website -> workspace -> Repository -> Repo settings**.
In the Repo settings:
- Go to **settings** and enable the pipelines.

![Enable pipelines](../assets/bitbucket/v2/bitbucketenablepipelines.png)

- Go to **Repository variables** and enter the Api key name **FD_API_KEY** and Api Key value

![Configure Api Key](../assets/bitbucket/v2/bitbucketrepovariables.png)

After adding the file you should commit. Based on which branch you've commited, if the branch is included in the given file, the respective data like libraries, secrets will be sent to FlyingDuck portal.

#### Custom Branch
If you want to commit to the custom branch like `features/**********` and to check the findings of that branch then include that specific branch into the branches in bitbucket-pipelines.yml file.

```mdx filename="bitbucket-pipelines.yml" copy

# Triggers the workflow on push events        
    master:
      - step: *DuckDefender
    develop:
      - step: *DuckDefender
    release:
      - step: *DuckDefender
```
