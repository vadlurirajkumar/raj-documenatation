#### Download DuckDefender

After selecting GitLab workflow, then click the **Download**. This will download the gitlab-ci.yml file which looks like this.



```mdx filename="gitlab-ci.yml" copy
image: docker:stable

services:
  - docker:dind

variables:
  DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR: "/certs"
  # DOCKER_TAG: "schalla/test:dev-0.0.22"
  # DOCKER_TAG:  "flyingduckio/duckdefender:latest"
  # schalla/duckdefender-v2:dev-0.0.73
  # schalla/duckdefender-v2:test-0.0.11
  DOCKER_TAG: schalla/duckdefender-v2:test-0.0.12
  # FD_API_KEY: "fdv1-fb5693ae-45bd-44d4-b8f0-fcc92d98cca0"
  FD_API_KEY: "$FD_API_KEY"

  

stages:
  - build_and_run

DuckDefender:
  
  stage: build_and_run
  script:
    # Check if Docker is installed and its version  
    - docker --version

    # Try to pull the Docker image
    - docker pull $DOCKER_TAG

    # Run the Docker container
    - docker run -e FD_API_KEY="$FD_API_KEY" -e LOG_LEVEL="debug" -e CI_COMMIT_BRANCH="$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH" -e CI_COMMIT_BEFORE_SHA="$CI_COMMIT_BEFORE_SHA" -e CI_COMMIT_AUTHOR="$CI_COMMIT_AUTHOR" -v $CI_PROJECT_DIR:/src "$DOCKER_TAG"

# Define the jobs for specific branches
main:
  only:
    - main
  extends: DuckDefender
```

After adding the file you should commit. Based on which branch you've commited, if the branch is included in the given file, the respective data like libraries, secrets will be sent to FlyingDuck portal.

#### Custom Branch
If you want to commit to the custom branch like `features/**********` and to check the findings of that branch then include that specific branch into the branches in duckdefender.yaml file.

```mdx filename="DuckDefender.yml" copy

# Triggers the workflow on push events but only for the all the critical branches
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "master", "main", "release", "develop" ]
```
